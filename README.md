## Fate Verse
Fate series is a TYPE-MOON media collective that follows various events called Holy Grail Wars that involve Masters, generally accomplished magi, summoning Servants, Heroic Spirits, and battling each other until the last remaining pair can claim the purported Holy Grail. It began with the visual novelWP, Fate/stay night, and has since gathered a number of prequels, sequels, spin-offs, and adaptations bearing the same "Fate" name.
## Why I Like This
- I have been following medias surrounding the fate series from games and animations.
- My first interaction in the verse would be the Fate/Stay Night visual novel.
- I also like learning about history, even though the verse has it's own liberties about historical figures.
- The fate verse also has it's own story lines regarding their own created characters besides the historical figures.
- At it's core I loved the verse for it's different themes and story telling. From the history of the historical figures, their ideals and goals they wish for the grail; To the relationship dynamics of the masters, servants, and the people not involved in the war.
- There are various storylines and plots that intertwine that is larger in scope and is better than the MCU.
